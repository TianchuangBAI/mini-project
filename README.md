# mini-project

Here is the mini project 1 from IPEN 5810, and I finished this project with my teammate Mr. Zihao QU

In this project, we will try to use some mechine learning and NLP technologies to achieve following questions.

** Preprocess the text, such as removing punctuation marks, stop words, etc.
** Use natural language processing techniques to classify the topics in these employee reviews.
** Visualize and interpret the topic classification results.
** Use machine learning tools to rank the correlation between different topics and identify those that are mostly correlated with income/wage/salary.

In the Code file, Our team sperated those questions into four files.
